						Software Development has been a growing field since the invention of the modern computer in the early 20th century. In today’s world of technology and rapid advancement, managing the development of software has become a key issue in society. Large companies like Google are moving along by implementing styles of management like the “open office” and other forms of management. However, not every developer enjoys the same opinions and styles of development, ever person has their own preference to how things should be done. How effective are these strategies implemented by management on the larger scale? Additional research is required in the field of developing software in the workspace. My study will evaluate the link between styles of management and software engineer happiness in the office. I will explain why a single solution in management styles, office layouts, and ergonomic designs is not a perfect solution.

						 The term Software Engineering first came about in the 1968 NATO science committee conference. Up until then, the development of software was viewed as an art, having little to no standards (Adams 635). Software development has taken hold in larger, sophisticated, and more complex systems. The bigger a product becomes, the higher the need for well documented and well-maintained code. There are billions of lines of code being used today. Every day programmers look over this code and analyze it for security flaws or redundancies. Without strong organizational and management skills, this code can quickly turn to an undocumented mess (Ali 5).

					In a typical day, a programmer can be expected to attend meetings, read and write emails, give presentations, write and debug code, and talk with coworkers. They are also expected to communicate with the customer. A successful engineer can effectively gather requirements from the customer and translate the needs into production code. Often times this is an iterative process until the project is complete, requiring very good communication skills. Each programmer is expected to cooperate with their team members and produce code by themselves. Very few projects allow engineers to work completely alone. Teamwork and coordination to make code work is crucial to the success of any project. A big communication struggle is in meetings. Managers often hold meeting over much longer than the attention span of their workers, losing information and causing processes for working to take longer.
